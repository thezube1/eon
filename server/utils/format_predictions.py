analysis_text_used (e.g. "SOAP Note")
input_text (patient's self-report)
metrics_summary (aggregated wearable/lifestyle metrics)
predictions: a list of predicted diseases, where each prediction has:
"description" (e.g., "Coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft")
"icd9_code" (e.g., "414")
"probability" (a float between 0 and 1)
soap_note (a full SOAP note summarizing the case)

Your output should do the following:
Risk Categorization:
For each prediction, assign a risk category based on its probability:
High Risk: if probability â‰¥ 0.85
Moderate Risk: if probability is between 0.70 and 0.85
Low Risk: if probability < 0.70

Disease Clustering:
Group similar or related diseases into general clusters. For example, conditions related to heart health (like "Coronary atherosclerosis" and "Orthostatic hypotension") should be grouped under a "Cardiovascular" cluster.
Other clusters might include "Metabolic/Obesity," "Sleep Disorders," "Respiratory," "Neurological," etc.
If a prediction does not clearly fall into a known category (e.g., "Description not found" or ambiguous codes), assign it to an "Other" or "Uncategorized" group.

Output Format:
Format your output as a JSON array of clusters. Each cluster should be an object with:
- cluster_name: string
- diseases: array of objects with description and icd9_code
- risk_level: string ("High Risk", "Moderate Risk", or "Low Risk")
- explanation: string explaining the risk level

Make sure your output is clear, concise, and formatted as valid JSON. Use the input data to support your risk interpretations.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON array, with no additional text or formatting."""
